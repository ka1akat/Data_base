1.INNER JOIN returns only matching rows from both tables; LEFT JOIN returns all rows from the left table and matching ones from the right table (others become NULL).
2.CROSS JOIN is used when we need all possible combinations of rows from two tables.
3.In OUTER JOIN, a filter in WHERE may remove unmatched rows, while ON keeps them. For INNER JOIN, it makes no difference.
4.The result is 50 because 5 × 10 = 50.
5.NATURAL JOIN joins tables using all columns that have the same names in both tables.
6.Risks: unclear join conditions, unexpected joins when schema changes, and lower readability.
7.SELECT *
FROM B
RIGHT JOIN A ON A.id = B.id;
8.FULL OUTER JOIN is used when we need all rows from both tables, including unmatched rows on both sides.
