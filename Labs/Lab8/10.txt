--1
B-tree index is the default index type in PostgreSQL.
It is automatically used if no type is specified.
--2
A column is frequently used in WHERE conditions
A column is used in JOIN between tables
A column is used in ORDER BY or GROUP BY
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 1000;
--3
Do not create an index when:
The table is very small (for example, only 10–20 rows)
The column is frequently updated — indexes will slow down INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE
(Extra) When a column has many duplicate values (e.g., gender, is_active)
--4
The index must also be updated when data changes.
This means that too many indexes can slow down INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.
If you see Index Scan → the index is used.
If you see Seq Scan → PostgreSQL is reading the whole table (the index is not used).
