Task 3.6
a) Does Terminal 1 see the new product inserted by Terminal 2?
No.
Under REPEATABLE READ, Terminal 1 does not see rows inserted by another transaction after its own transaction began.
Terminal 1 will continue to see only the original snapshot (Coke and Pepsi).
b) What is a phantom read?
A phantom read occurs when a transaction repeats a query and gets additional rows that were not visible during the first read because another transaction inserted them in the meantime.
Short definition:
The same query returns a different set of rows due to new rows appearing.
c) Which isolation level prevents phantom reads?
SERIALIZABLE.
This level prevents phantom reads by making transactions behave as if they were executed one after another, not concurrently.

Task 3.7
a) Did Terminal 1 see the price of 99.99? Why is this problematic?
Yes.
Under READ UNCOMMITTED, Terminal 1 is allowed to see uncommitted changes made by Terminal 2.
This is problematic because:
Terminal 2 later performs ROLLBACK, so the change never officially existed.
Terminal 1 saw invalid, temporary, incorrect data, which can lead to wrong calculations or incorrect decisions.
b) What is a dirty read?
A dirty read happens when a transaction reads data that was changed by another transaction but not yet committed.
If the other transaction later rolls back, the data read was never real, making the first transaction’s results invalid.
c) Why should READ UNCOMMITTED be avoided in most applications?
Because it can produce:
Incorrect results (reading values that never become permanent)
Inconsistent state
Wrong calculations
Unpredictable behavior
READ UNCOMMITTED allows the dirtiest, least safe kind of reading — transactions can see data that might disappear after a rollback.
