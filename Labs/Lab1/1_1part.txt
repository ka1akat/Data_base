1.1
Relation 1
1.
SK1=(EmpID) → unique because each employee has their own ID.
SK2=(SSN) → unique since every person has a distinct SSN.
SK3=(Email) → work emails are unique identifiers.
SK4=(Phone) → in the sample data it is unique.
SK5=(EmpID, Name) → this combination guarantees uniqueness.
SK6=(SSN, Email) → this combination also provides uniqueness.
2.
CK1=(EmpID)
CK2=(SSN)
CK3=(Email)
These are minimal superkeys, because if you remove any attribute, the key would no longer uniquely identify a record.
3.
EmpID as the primary key because it is numeric and short, it does not change over time,
it is safer and more practical than using SSN or Email.
4.
Phone Numbers in the sample data, all phone numbers are unique.However, in real-world situations, two employees might share the same work phone (for example, in one department).

Relation 2
1.
Minimum attributes needed for primary key are: StudentID + CourseCode + Section + Semester + Year
2.
StudentID: identifies which student is registering. Without it, we could not distinguish registrations of different students for the same course.
CourseCode: identifies which course is being taken. Without it, we could not tell which course the student is registering for.
Section: a course can have multiple sections in the same semester. Without Section, two students in different sections of the same course would appear identical.
Semester: a student can take the same course in different semesters. Without Semester, repeated registrations across semesters would be treated as duplicates.
Year: he same semester repeats every year. Without Year, registrations in different academic years could not be distinguished.
3.
The only candidate key for the Registration relation is the combination:
(StudentID, CourseCode, Section, Semester, Year).
StudentID alone is not unique, since one student can register for multiple courses.
CourseCode alone is not unique, since many students can register for the same course.
Therefore, no single attribute is sufficient.
The minimal unique combination is (StudentID, CourseCode, Section, Semester, Year), which serves as both the candidate key and the primary key.
